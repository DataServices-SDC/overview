### General Info

Scalable e-commerce backend with optimizations to handle increased web traffic

* Optimized with load balancing, bringing response times down from 800ms to 11ms while handling over 1,000 clients per second with no timeouts and < 0.1% error rate
* Optimized database query response times from 2400ms to 7ms by implementing database indexes
* Designed a Node-express server and PostgreSQL database to handle requests from a retail website and provide responses with specifically formatted JSON text.
* Server and database were uploaded into Amazon EC2 t2-micro instances:
* 1 instance running NGINX for load balancing
* 4 instances running identical images of the node server
* 1 instance containing the PostgreSQL database
* Stress testing conducted using Loader.io for server performance.
* Each query contained a product chosen at random from > one million possibilities
* Requests were sent at 1000rps intervals
